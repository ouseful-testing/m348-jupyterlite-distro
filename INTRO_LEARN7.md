# Introduction

The *M348 JupyterLite Learn7 / Virtual Campus Resource* is a self-contained HTML interactive resource that provides a powerful JupyterLab environment that you can access using your web browser.

All code is executed within the browser, and no files need to be loaded from external websites. This means that the application can be run purely from an Open University Learn7 / Virtual Campus module website.

Files can be mounted into the JupyterLab environment from your computer, edited in the browser, and saved back to your computer.

*If you have an issues or problems running the application, or any comments or feedback about how we might improve it, please pass them on to the module team via your tutor.*
