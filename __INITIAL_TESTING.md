Two notebooks are bundled into the environment: `M348-styling-test.ipynb` and `M348-code-tests.ipynb`.

In the local JupyterLab file browser, double click on the `M348-styling-test.ipynb` notebook to open it. It should render a notebook containing coloured cells and an embedded image, {ref}`styling_test_notebook`.

```{figure} images/styling_test_notebook.png

Double click on the `M348-code-tests.ipynb` notebook to open it. From the `Run` menu, select *Run All Cells*.

Hopefully, each cell will run correctly (indicated by a green block in left hand margin of each cell). *Note the test to read a written CSV data file may fail. Everything else should pass.*
