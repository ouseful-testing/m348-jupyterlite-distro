# Introduction

The M348 JupyterLite Desktop application is a self-contained executable package that publishes a powerful JupyterLab environment from your computer desktop that you can access using your web browser.

All code is executed within the browser, and no files need to be loaded from external websites. This means that the application can be run without any access to a network connection.

Files can be mounted into the JupyterLab environment from the desktop, edited in the browser, and saved back to the desktop.

Data files located in the `M348-24J` directory your home directory can also be *read* from code running in the browser.
