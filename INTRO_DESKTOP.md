# Introduction

The *M348 JupyterLite Desktop Application* is a self-contained executable package that publishes a powerful JupyterLab environment from your computer that you can access using your web browser.

All code is executed within the browser, and no files need to be loaded from external websites. This means that the application can be run without any access to a network connection.

Files can be mounted into the JupyterLab environment from your computer, edited in the browser, and saved back to your computer.

Data files located in the `M348-24J` directory your home directory can also be *read* from code running in the browser.

*If you have an issues or problems running the application, or any comments or feedback about how we might improve it, please pass them on to the module team via your tutor.*
